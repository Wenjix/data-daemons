  "text": "Just captured this amazing sunset photo at Mirror Lake! The sky was painted in layers of orange, pink, and purple, perfectly reflected in the crystal-clear water. The silhouette of the pine trees along the shoreline creates such a dramatic contrast. Shot with a 24mm lens at f/8, golden hour lighting was absolutely perfect. The composition follows the rule of thirds with the horizon line and the mountain peak as focal points. Really proud of how this one turned out - the colors are unedited, nature was just showing off today!",
