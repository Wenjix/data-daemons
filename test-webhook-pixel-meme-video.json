It's that audio that goes \"Monday again?\" with the dramatic opera music, but someone edited it with clips of people dramatically falling or collapsing. The way they cut to that scene from The Office where everyone's just dead inside at their desks??? TOO REAL. And then it transitions to someone aggressively hitting the snooze button like they're fighting for their life 😴⚔️ The comments section is full of people being like \"why am I in this video without my consent\" and honestly SAME. It's giving \"gaslight, gatekeep, girl-boss but make it exhausted millennial.\" Already reposted it with the caption \"me pretending I have my life together\" and it got 500 likes in an hour. This is the relatability we all need. 10/10 would watch on loop while procrastinating.",
