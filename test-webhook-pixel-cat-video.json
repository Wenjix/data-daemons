The confidence in its eyes right before the jump??? PRICELESS. And then it just slides down the cabinet in slow motion like a cartoon character 😂😂😂 The way it looks around afterwards like \"did anyone see that?\" and tries to play it cool by grooming itself... I CAN'T. Already sent it to like 10 people. This is peak cat content. The internet was invented for moments like this. Video is only 15 seconds but I've watched it 47 times already. Send help. #CatFail #FelineComedy",
