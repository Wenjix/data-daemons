  "text": "Sharing my research findings for our Environmental Science project on climate change effects on marine biodiversity. After analyzing data from the past 30 years, I've found significant correlations between ocean temperature rise and coral reef degradation. Key findings: 1) Average ocean temperatures have increased by 0.13°C per decade since 1990. 2) This correlates with a 50% reduction in live coral coverage in the Great Barrier Reef. 3) Species migration patterns show tropical fish moving toward polar regions at rates of 70km per decade. The most concerning discovery is the acceleration of ocean acidification - pH levels have dropped from 8.2 to 8.1, which may seem small but represents a 30% increase in acidity. I'm using sources from Nature Climate Change, NOAA databases, and the IPCC reports. For the methodology section, I employed statistical regression analysis and comparative ecosystem modeling. Still need to complete the literature review section on adaptation strategies. Planning to argue that immediate policy intervention is critical based on the trajectory of current data. Would appreciate feedback on the data visualization graphs I've created showing temperature-biodiversity correlation. Due date is in three weeks but want to get a solid draft done early.",
