  "text": "Okay so I found this 10-minute compilation of people failing at the most random stuff and I'm deceased. There's this one clip of a guy trying to do a backflip off a diving board and he just... belly flops in the most spectacular way possible. The SOUND it makes!!! And then there's a wedding video where the groom tries to dip the bride but they both fall over and knock into the cake 🎂💥 The best part? The bride is laughing so hard she can't even be mad. Also featuring: skateboard fails, trampoline disasters, and someone trying to slide down a stair railing at the office. Why do people record themselves doing these things?? Thank goodness they do though because this content is GOLD. My face hurts from laughing. Instant mood booster! Everyone needs to watch this.",
