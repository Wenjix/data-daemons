  "subject": "Fascinating Data Visualization on Coffee Consumption",
  "text": "Check out this incredible infographic I found! It visualizes global coffee consumption patterns from 2020-2024. The design uses a coffee cup as the central element, with streams of data flowing out like steam. Each color represents a different region - Europe in warm brown, Asia in golden yellow, Americas in rich espresso tones. The statistics are mind-blowing: Finland leads per capita consumption at 12kg per person annually! The infographic also breaks down preferences: espresso vs drip, hot vs iced, with sleek pie charts integrated into coffee bean shapes. The typography is clean and modern, using a sans-serif font that pairs perfectly with the organic data visualization. The whole thing has this minimalist Scandinavian design aesthetic that makes complex data feel accessible and beautiful.",
