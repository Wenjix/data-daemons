  "subject": "New Character Design - Cyberpunk Hacker",
  "text": "Finished my latest digital illustration! It's a cyberpunk character - a street hacker with neon-blue hair and augmented reality glasses. The aesthetic is dark with lots of glowing elements: neon signs in the background, holographic interfaces, and electric blue accents throughout. Used a limited color palette of deep purples, blues, and hot pink highlights to create that classic cyberpunk mood. The character has this confident pose, surrounded by floating code and digital glyphs. Drew inspiration from Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. Really happy with how the lighting turned out - lots of rim lighting and reflection effects to make everything pop. Created in Procreate with about 40 layers!",
